We will implement issue $ARGUMENTS. Please review the issues first to understand what we're doing. You will  
then spawn multiple concurrent subagents in parallel to do the following:                                 

- one will review the codebase to research the integration points for the new code or code to modify. If  
the feature has already been implemented they will make note of that.                                     
- one will review the tastytrade python SDK reference to compare the implementation to fully explain      
what features we are copying.                                                                             
- one will review the tastytrade python SDK cli tool reference to fully explain what features we are      
trying to copy.                                                                                           
                                                                                                             
You will then take the output from the subagents to compile an implementation plan and update the todos   
to fully encapsulate the work down to the smallest possible unit of work. You will not continue until I   
approve the plan.
